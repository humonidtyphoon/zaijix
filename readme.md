Website Goals

The website must prioritize:

Brand awareness

Lead generation

Impressing Geotab as part of the reseller evaluation
(IMPORTANT: Present Zaijix as “telecom & telematics solutions provider” without explicitly claiming partnership with Geotab until approval.)

The AI agent must ensure:

The messaging is enterprise-level, gov-ready, and highly professional.

The website positions Zaijix as technically strong and market-ready.

2. Required Pages

The website must include ONLY the following pages:

(1) Home

Hero section

Value proposition

Short intro to Zaijix

Key services overview

Link to About / Services / Contact

(2) About Us

Company summary

Vision & Mission

Leadership overview

Market opportunity (Jordan)

(3) Services

Show the telematics-related services Zaijix can offer without claiming official Geotab status:

Fleet telematics solutions

Data and analytics

Fleet safety & compliance

Operational visibility & optimization

Software integrations / APIs

Fuel cost reduction consulting

IMPORTANT:
The page must not state “Geotab reseller” or “Official partner” yet.
Use neutral terms like “Powered by global telematics standards” or “Compatible with enterprise telematics technologies.”

(4) Industries

Only one page covering 3 industries aligned with Manaseer:

Energy & Fuel Distribution

Logistics & Transportation

Retail & Delivery

Avoid making claims about other industries until expansion is ready.

(5) FAQ

Include common questions such as:

What is fleet telematics?

How can telematics reduce fuel costs?

What industries benefit most?

Is Zaijix operational yet?

What solutions does Zaijix provide?

All answers must be written professionally and confidently, without claiming official partnerships.

(6) Contact Us

Only include:

Contact form

Email: info@zaijix.com

No phone

No physical address yet

3. Tone & Communication Style

The AI agent must write all text in the following tone:

Corporate (enterprise-level)

Technical (accurate IoT/telematics vocabulary)

Government-friendly (formal, credible)

Professional and concise

No casual language.
No exaggerated marketing claims.
No references to being a Geotab partner (only “expertise in fleet telematics technologies”).

4. Branding Requirements

Since Zaijix has no branding yet, here is the required temporary color palette for the AI agent to use:

Recommended Color Palette (Corporate + Tech + Gov)

These colors give a professional, tech-trustworthy impression:

Primary Blue: #0A2A43 (strong, governmental, corporate)

Secondary Blue: #1F5F8B (technical, clean)

Accent Teal: #4FB3BF (modern, innovation signal)

Neutral Dark: #1B1B1B

Neutral Light: #F5F7F9 (background)

This palette:

Fits government/enterprise environments

Looks like a serious telematics brand

Is NOT dependent on Geotab branding

Works well for future mobile app / dashboards

Typography (AI agent should choose compatible fonts):

Headings: Inter / Poppins / Montserrat

Body Text: Inter / Roboto

5. Visual Style Instructions

The website design must follow:

Clean, enterprise-style layout

Lots of white/light space

Professional icons

Clear section dividers

No cartoony illustrations

No stock photos of generic GPS icons

Images should be modern: fleets, dashboards, enterprise teams, infrastructure

6. Content Restrictions

The AI agent MUST NOT:

Claim Zaijix is a Geotab partner

Use Geotab logos

Mention device models like “GO9” unless phrased as “industry-standard telematics devices”

Include pricing

Include unsupported industries

Mention political connections

7. Messaging That Should Be Included

The website should highlight:

Jordan’s high fuel costs

Jordan’s under-digitalized fleets

Importance of telematics

Benefits of real-time data

Manaseer pilot (without exaggeration)

Example phrasing:

“Zaijix is currently preparing a pilot program with Manaseer Group to demonstrate measurable improvements in fleet fuel efficiency and operational visibility.”

8. Services Positioning (Before Geotab Approval)

Since Zaijix cannot yet claim partnership, the AI agent should use:

Correct phrasing

“Fleet telematics solutions powered by global technologies”

“Enterprise-grade data insights and operational intelligence”

“Compatible with leading telematics platforms”

“Telematics integration and optimization services”

Avoid phrasing

“Official reseller”

“Geotab-certified”

“Authorized distributor”

After Geotab approval, the content can be updated.

9. Contact Page Requirements

Only include:

Email: info@zaijix.com

Contact form (name, email, company, message)

No address
No phone
No WhatsApp

Should we mention telematics services even without Geotab?

Yes — but use generic phrasing (enterprise telematics, global standards, etc.).
I structured the checklist to avoid any risk.

Should we mention Manaseer?

Yes, on the Home and About page.
This impresses Geotab.

Should we add more industries?

No — only energy, logistics, and retail for now.

Color palette?

Chosen above (corporate, tech, gov-friendly).

Do we add additional features like blogs?

No — keep it clean and simple for now.
